Group Policy Objects (GPOs):

A Group Policy Object (GPO) is a virtual collection of policy settings that can be applied to user(s) or computer(s).
GPOs include policies such as screen lock timeout, disabling USB ports, enforcing a custom domain password policy, installing software, managing applications, customizing remote access settings, and much more.
____________________________________________

GPO settings are processed using the hierarchical structure of AD and are applied using the Order of Precedence rule as seen in the table below:

Local Group Policy	                        The policies are defined directly to the host locally outside the domain. Any setting here will be overwritten if a similar setting is defined at a higher level.
Site Policy	                                Any policies specific to the Enterprise Site that the host resides in. Remember that enterprise environments can span large campuses and even across countries. So it stands to reason that a site might have its own policies to follow that could differentiate it from the rest of the organization. Access Control policies are a great example of this. Say a specific building or site performs secret or restricted research and requires a higher level of authentication for access to resources. You could specify those settings at the site level and ensure they are linked so as not to be overwritten by domain policy. This is also a great way to perform actions like printer and share mapping for users in specific sites.
Domain-wide Policy	                        Any settings you wish to have applied across the domain as a whole. For example, setting the password policy complexity level, configuring a Desktop background for all users, and setting a Notice of Use and Consent to Monitor banner at the login screen.
Organizational Unit (OU)	                These settings would affect users and computers who belong to specific OUs. You would want to place any unique settings here that are role-specific. For example, the mapping of a particular share drive that can only be accessed by HR, access to specific resources like printers, or the ability for IT admins to utilize PowerShell and command-prompt.
Any OU Policies nested within other OU's	Settings at this level would reflect special permissions for objects within nested OUs. For example, providing Security Analysts a specific set of Applocker policy settings that differ from the standard IT Applocker settings.

GPO Order of Precedence:

GPOs are processed from the top down when viewing them from a domain organizational standpoint. A GPO linked to an OU at the highest level in an Active Directory network (at the domain level, for example) would be processed first, followed by those linked to a child OU, etc.
This means that a GPO linked directly to an OU containing user or computer objects is processed last.
In other words, a GPO attached to a specific OU would have precedence over a GPO attached at the domain level because it will be processed last and could run the risk of overriding settings in a GPO higher up in the domain hierarchy.
One more thing to keep track of with precedence is that a setting configured in Computer policy will always have a higher priority of the same setting applied to a user.
The following graphic illustrates precedence and how it is applied.

5.Child OU Policy
4.Parent OU Policy
3.Domain Policy
2.Site Policy
1.Local Security Policy

Group Policy Refresh Frequency:

Windows performs periodic Group Policy updates, which by default is done every 90 minutes with a randomized offset of +/- 30 minutes for users and computers

It is possible to change the default refresh interval within Group Policy itself. Furthermore, we can issue the command gpupdate /force to kick off the update process. 

We can modify the refresh interval via Group Policy by clicking on Computer Configuration --> Policies --> Administrative Templates --> System --> Group Policy and selecting Set Group Policy refresh interval for computers.
