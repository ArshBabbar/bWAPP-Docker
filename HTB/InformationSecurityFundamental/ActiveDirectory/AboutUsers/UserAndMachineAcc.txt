Domain-joined vs Non-Domain-joined Machines

Domain-joined:

hosts have greater ease of information sharing within the enterprise and a centeral management point(the DC)to gather resources,policies and updates form.

Non-Domain-joined:

these are not managed by domain policy.sharing resources outside your local network is much more complicated then it would be on a domain.
advantage being individual users are in charge of any changes they wish to make to their hosts.

machince account(NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM level access)in an AD env will have most of the same rights as a standard domain user accounts.
