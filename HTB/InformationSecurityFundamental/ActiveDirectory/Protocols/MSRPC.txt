MSRPC is Microsoft's implementation of remote procedure call(RPC),
an interprocess communication technique used for client-server model-based application.
Windows uses MSRPC to access systems in AD using 4 key RPC interfaces as:

1.lsarpc :a set of RPC calls to the Local Security Authority(LSA) system which manages the local security policy on a computer,controls the audit policy and provides interactive authentication services.
         LSARPC is used to perform management on domain security policies.

2.netlogon :Netlogon is a Windows process used to authenticate users and other services in the domain environment.
            it is as ervice that continuously runs in the background.

3.samr :Remote SAM(samr) provides management functionality for the domain account database, storing info about user and groups.
        IT admins use the protocol to manage users,groups and computer by enablind admins to create,read,update and delete information about security principles.

4.drsuapi : it is the Microsoft API that implements the Directory Replication Service(DRS) Remote Protocol which is used to perform replication-related tasks across Domain Controllers in a multi-DC environment.
