active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) uses DNS to allow clients to locate DC and for DC that host the directory service to communicate ammong themselves.
DNS is used to resolve hostnames to IP addresses and is  broadly used across internal networks and the internet.
Private internal networks use Active Directory DNS namespaces to facilate communications between servers,clients and peers.
AD maintains a database of services running on the network in the form of service records (SRV).
these records allows clients in an AD environment to locate services that they need,such as a file server,printer or DC.
Dynamic DNS is used to make changes in the DNS database automatically should a system's IP address change.

When a client joins the network,it locates the DC by sending a query to the DNS service,retrieving an SRV record from the DNS database and transmitting the DC's hostname to the client.
the client then uses this hostname to obtain IP address of DC.

DNS uses port 53(TCP and UDP),DNS messages are larger than 512 bytes
