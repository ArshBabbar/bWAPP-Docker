AD supports Lightweight directory access protocol for directory lookups.
LDAP is an open source and cross-platform protocol used for authentication against various directory servies.
LDAP uses port 389 and LDAP over ssh uses port 636

LDAP is the language that applications use to communicate with other services that proviedes directory services.
IN other words,LDAP is how system in the network env can "speak" to AD.

AN LDAP session begins by first connection to an LDAP server,also known as Directory System Agent.
THE DC in AD avtively listens for LDAP requests,such as security authentication requests.

--- AD LDAP AUTHENTICATION ----

LDAP is set up to authenticate credentials against AD using a "BIND" operation to set the authentication state for an LDAP session.
2 types of LDAP authentications are:

-Simple authentication :this includes anonymous authentication,unauthenticated authentication and username/password authentication.
                        it means that a username and password create a BIND request to authenticate to the LDAP server.

-SASL Authentication :The Simple Authentication and Security Layer(SASL) framework uses other authentication services,such as kerberous,to bind the LDAP server and then uses this authentication service to authenticate to LDAP.
                      SASL can provice additional security due to the separation of authentication methods from application protocols.

LDAP authentication messages are sent in cleartext by default so anyone can sniff out LDAP messages on the internal network.
