Kerberos is the default authentication protocol for domain accounts since Windows 2000
it is an open standard and allows for interoperability with other systems using the same standard.
when a user logs into their PC,Kerberos is used to authenticate them via mutal authentiaction or both the user and the server verify their identity.
it is a stateless authentication protocol based on tickets instead of transmitting user passwords over the network.
as part of AD DS, DC have a Kerberos Key DIstribution Center(KDC) that issues tickets.
|when a user initiates a login request to a system,the client they are using to authenticate request a ticket from the KDC
|encrypting the request with the user's password.
if the KDC can decrypt the request(AS-REQ) using their password,it will create a Ticket Granting Ticket(TGT) and transmit it to the user.
the user then presents its TGT to a DC to request a Ticket Granting Service(TGS) ticket,encrypted with the associated service's NTLM password hash.
|Finally,the client requests access to the required service by oresenting the TGS to the application or service,which decrypts it with its password hash.
|if the entire process completes appropriately,the user will be permitted to access the requested service or app.

The KDC does not record previous transactions.
instead TGS relies on a valid TGT 

Working 

1. Client Request TGT                                   ----->
2. (Kerberos service)KDC receive TGT                    <-----
3. presents TGT and Req TGS                             ----->
4. rec TGS                                              <-----
5.client presents TGS for service access to database    ----->

Uses port 88(both TCP and UDP)
