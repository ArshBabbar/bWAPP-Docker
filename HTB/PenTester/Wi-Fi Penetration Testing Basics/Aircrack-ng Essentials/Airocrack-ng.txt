Aircrack-ng is a powerful tool designed for network security testing, capable of cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 networks that use pre-shared keys or PMKID.

________________________________
Aircrack-ng Benchmark

it is imperative to assess the benchmark of the host system to ensure its capability to execute brute-force attacks effectively.
Aircrack-ng has a benchmark mode to test CPU performance. 
Cmd:
aircrack-ng -S

________________________________
Cracking WEP


It is possible to save only the captured IVs (Initialization Vectors) using the --ivs option in Airodump-ng.
Once enough IVs are captured, we can utilize the -K option in Aircrack-ng, which invokes the Korek WEP cracking method to crack the WEP key.
Cmd:
aircrack-ng -K HTB.ivs 

________________________________
Cracking WPA

Aircrack-ng has the capability to crack the WPA key once a "four-way handshake" has been captured using Airodump-ng.
To crack WPA/WPA2 pre-shared keys, only a dictionary-based method can be employed, which necessitates the use of a wordlist containing potential passwords.
Aircrack-ng can effectively operate with just two packets. Specifically, EAPOL packets 2 and 3, or packets 3 and 4, are considered a full handshake.
Cmd:
aircrack-ng HTB.pcap -w /opt/wordlist.txt
