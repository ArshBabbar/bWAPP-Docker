The primary function of Aireplay-ng is to generate traffic for later use in aircrack-ng for cracking the WEP and WPA-PSK keys.

To list all the features of aireplay-ng we use the following command.
Cmd:
aireplay-ng

It currently implements multiple different attacks:
Attack 	    Attack Name
Attack 0 	Deauthentication
Attack 1 	Fake authentication
Attack 2 	Interactive packet replay
Attack 3 	ARP request replay attack
Attack 4 	KoreK chopchop attack
Attack 5 	Fragmentation attack
Attack 6 	Cafe-latte attack
Attack 7 	Client-oriented fragmentation attack
Attack 8 	WPA Migration Mode
Attack 9 	Injection test

As we can see, the flag for deauthentication is -0 or --deauth.
This attack can be used to disconnect clients from the access point (AP).
By using aireplay-ng, we can send deauthentication packets to the AP. 

_________________________________
Testing for Packet Injection

Before sending deauthentication frames, it's important to verify if our wireless card can successfully inject frames into the target access point (AP).
his can be tested by measuring the ping response times from the AP, which gives us an indication of the link quality based on the percentage of responses received.
Furthermore, if we are using two wireless cards, this test can help identify which card is more effective for injection attacks.

Once we have our interface in monitor mode, it is very easy for us to test it for packet injection.
We can utilize Aireplay-ng's test mode as follows.
Cmd
sudo aireplay-ng --test wlan0mon

Using Aireplay-ng to perform Deauthentication

sudo aireplay-ng -0 5 -a 00:14:6C:7A:41:81 -c 00:0F:B5:32:31:31 wlan0mon


    -0 means deauthentication
    5 is the number of deauths to send (you can send multiple if you wish); 0 means send them continuously
    -a 00:14:6C:7A:41:81 is the MAC address of the access point
    -c 00:0F:B5:32:31:31 is the MAC address of the client to deauthenticate; if this is omitted then all clients are deauthenticated
    wlan0mon is the interface name
