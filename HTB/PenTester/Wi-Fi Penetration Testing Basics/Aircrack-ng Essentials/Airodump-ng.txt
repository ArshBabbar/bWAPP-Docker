Airodump-ng serves as a tool for capturing packets, specifically targeting raw 802.11 frames.
Its primary function lies in the collection of WEP IVs (Initialization Vectors) or WPA/WPA2 handshakes, which are subsequently utilized with aircrack-ng for security assessment purposes.

airodump-ng provides a wealth of information when scanning for WiFi networks. The table below explains each field along with its description:

Field 	    Description
BSSID 	    Shows the MAC address of the access points
PWR 	    Shows the "power" of the network. The higher the number, the better the signal strength.
Beacons 	Shows the number of announcement packets sent by the network.
#Data 	    Shows the number of captured data packets.
#/s 	    Shows the number of data packets captured in the past ten seconds.
CH 	        Shows the "Channel" the network runs on.
MB 	        Shows the maximum speed supported by the network.
ENC 	    Shows the encryption method used by the network.
CIPHER 	    Shows the cipher used by the network.
AUTH 	    Shows the authentication used by the network.
ESSID 	    Shows the name of the network.
STATION 	Shows the MAC address of the client connected to the network.
RATE 	    Shows the data transfer rate between the client and the access point.
LOST 	    Shows the number of data packets lost.
Packets 	Shows the number of data packets sent by the client.
Notes 	    Shows additional information about the client, such as captured EAPOL or PMKID.
PROBES 	    Shows the list of networks the client is probing for.

________________________________
Scanning Specific Channels or a Single Channel

The command airodump-ng wlan0mon initiates a comprehensive scan, collecting data on wireless access points across all the channels available.
However, we can specify a particular channel using the -c option to focus the scan on a specific frequency.
Cmd:
sudo airodump-ng -c 11 wlan0mon

It is also possible to select multiple channels for scanning using the command airodump-ng -c 1,6,11 wlan0mon.

________________________________
Scanning 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands

By default, airodump-ng is configured to scan exclusively for networks operating on the 2.4 GHz band. 
we can instruct airodump-ng to include this frequency range in its scan by utilizing the --band option.

We can find a list of all WLAN channels and bands available for Wi-Fi here->https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels

The supported bands are a, b, and g.

    a uses 5 GHz
    b uses 2.4 GHz
    g uses 2.4 GHz

________________________________
Saving the output to a file

We can preserve the outcomes of our airodump-ng scan by utilizing the --write <prefix> parameter. 

For instance, executing airodump-ng wlan0mon --write HTB will generate the following files in the current directory.

    HTB-01.cap
    HTB-01.csv
    HTB-01.kismet.csv
    HTB-01.kismet.netxml
    HTB-01.log.csv
