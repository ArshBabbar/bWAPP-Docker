Aircrack-ng focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further processing by third party tools.
Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others via packet injection.
Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and injection).
Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).

All tools within Aircrack-ng operate through command-line interfaces, facilitating extensive scripting capabilities.
This attribute has been leveraged by numerous graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
Aircrack-ng predominantly functions on Linux platforms but extends compatibility to Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and even eComStation 2.
The Aircrack-ng suite encompasses over 20 tools tailored for auditing Wi-Fi networks.
We'll concentrate on the six most frequently utilized and essential tools within the suite.
