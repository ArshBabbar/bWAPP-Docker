Airdecap-ng is a valuable tool for decrypting wireless capture files once we have obtained the key to a network.
It can decrypt WEP, WPA PSK, and WPA2 PSK captures.

it can remove wireless headers from an unencrypted capture file.

Airdecap-ng can be used for the following:

    Removing wireless headers from an open network capture (Unencrypted capture).
    Decrypting a WEP-encrypted capture file using a hexadecimal WEP key.
    Decrypting a WPA/WPA2-encrypted capture file using the passphrase.

_________________________________
Using Airdecap-ng

Cmd:
airdecap-ng [options] <pcap file>

Option 	Description
-l 	    don't remove the 802.11 header
-b 	    access point MAC address filter
-k 	    WPA/WPA2 Pairwise Master Key in hex
-e 	    target network ascii identifier
-p 	    target network WPA/WPA2 passphrase
-w 	    target network WEP key in hexadecimal

Airdecap-ng generates a new file with the suffix -dec.cap, which contains the decrypted or stripped version of the original input file.
For instance, an input file named HTB-01.cap will result in an unencrypted output file named HTB-01-dec.cap.

_________________________________
Removing Wireless Headers from Unencrypted Capture file

Capturing packets on an open network would result in an unencrypted capture file.

To remove the wireless headers from the capture file using Airdecap-ng, we can use the following command:
Cmd:
airdecap-ng -b <bssid> <capture-file>

This will produce a decrypted file with the suffix -dec.cap, such as opencapture-dec.cap, containing the streamlined data ready for further analysis.

_________________________________
Decrypting WEP-encrypted captures

Once we have obtained the hexadecimal WEP key, we can use it to decrypt the captured packets.
To decrypt a WEP-encrypted capture file using Airdecap-ng, we can use the following command:
Cmd:
airdecap-ng -w <WEP-key> <capture-file>

Replace <WEP-key> with the hexadecimal WEP key and with the name of the capture file.

For example:
sudo airdecap-ng -w 1234567890ABCDEF HTB-01.cap
This will produce a decrypted file with the suffix -dec.cap, such as HTB-01-dec.cap, containing the unencrypted data ready for further analysis.

________________________________
Decrypting WPA-encrypted captures

Airdecap-ng can also decrypt WPA-encrypted capture files, provided we have the passphrase.

To decrypt a WPA-encrypted capture file using Airdecap-ng, we can use the following command:
Cmd:
airdecap-ng -p <passphrase> <capture-file> -e <essid>

For example:
sudo airdecap-ng -p 'abdefg' HTB-01.cap -e "Wireless Lab"

This will produce a decrypted file with the suffix -dec.cap, such as HTB-01-dec.cap, containing the unencrypted data ready for further analysis.
