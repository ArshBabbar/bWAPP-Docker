Monitor mode is a specialized mode for wireless network interfaces, enabling them to capture all traffic within a WiFi range. 
By enabling monitor mode, users can intercept and analyze packets, detect unauthorized devices, identify network vulnerabilities, and gather comprehensive data on wireless networks.

Starting monitor mode

Airmon-ng can be used to enable monitor mode on wireless interfaces.
It may also be used to kill network managers, or go back from monitor mode to managed mode.
Entering the airmon-ng command without parameters will show the wireless interface name, driver and chipset.
Cmd:
 sudo airmon-ng

We can set the wlan0 interface into monitor mode using the command airmon-ng start wlan0.
Cmd:
 sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

___________________________________
Checking for interfering processes

When putting a card into monitor mode, it will automatically check for interfering processes.
It can also be done manually by running the following command:
Cmd:
 sudo airmon-ng check

___________________________________
Starting monitor mode on a specific channel

It is also possible to set the wireless card to a specific channel using airmon-ng.
We can specify the desired channel while enabling monitor mode on the wlan0 interface.
Cmd:
 sudo airmon-ng start wlan0 11

___________________________________
Stopping monitor mode

We can stop the monitor mode on the wlan0mon interface using the command airmon-ng stop wlan0mon.
Cmd:
 sudo airmon-ng stop wlan0mon
