In 802.11 communications, there are a few different frame types utilized for different actions. 
These actions are all a part of the connection cycle, and standard communications for these wireless networks

___________________________________

The IEEE 802.11 MAC Frame


All 802.11 frames utilize the MAC frame.
This frame is the foundation for all other fields and actions that are performed between the client and access point,
and even in ad-hoc networks.
The MAC data frame consists of 9 fields.

Field	                Description
Frame Control	        This field contains tons of information such as type, subtype, protocol version, to ds (distribution system), from DS, Order, etcetera.
Duration/ID	            This ID clarifies the amount of time in which the wireless medium is occupied.
Address 1, 2, 3, and 4	These fields clarify the MAC addresses involved in the communication, but they could mean different things depending on the origin of the frame. These tend to include the BSSID of the access point and the client MAC address, among others.
SC	                    The sequence control field allows additional capabilities to prevent duplicate frames.
Data	                Simply put, this field is responsible for the data that is transmitted from the sender to the receiver.
CRC	                    The cyclic redundancy check contains a 32-bit checksum for error detection.

IEEE 802.11 Frame Types
IEEE frames can be put into different categories for what they do and what actions they are involved in. Generally speaking, we have the following types among some others. These codes can help us when filtering Wireshark traffic.

Management (00): These frames are used for management and control, and allowing the access point and client to control the active connection.
Control (01): Control frames are used for managing the transmission and reception of data frames within wi-fi networks. We can consider them like a sense of quality control.
Data (10): Data frames are used to contain data for transmission.

Management Frame Sub-Types
Primarily, for wi-fi penetration testing, we focus on management frames. These frames after all are used to control the connection between the access point and client. As such we can dive into each one, and what they are responsible for.

If we look to filter them in Wireshark, we would specify type 00 and subtypes like the following.

Beacon Frames (1000)
Probe Request (0100) and Probe Response (0101)
Authentication Request and Response (1011)
Association/Reassociation Request and Responses (0000, 0001, 0010, 0011)
Disassociation/Deauthentication (1010, 1100)

1. Beacon Frames
Beacon frames are primarily used by the access point to communicate its presence to the client or station.

2. Probe Requests and Responses
The probe request and response process exist to allow the client to discover nearby access points.

3. Authentication Request and Response
Authentication requests are sent by the client to the access point to begin the connection process. 

4. Association/Reassociation Requests
After sending an authentication request and undergoing the authentication process, the client sends an association request to the access point.

5. Disassociation/Deauthentication Frames
Disassociation and Deauthentication frames are sent from the access point to the client. Similar to their inverse frames (association and authentication),
they are designed to terminate the connection between the access point and the client.

The Connection Cycle

the general connection cycle follows this sequence.

Beacon Frames
Probe Request and Response
Authentication Request and Response
Association Request and Response
Some form of handshake or other security mechanism
Disassociation/Deauthentication

-->
Beacon frames from the access point can be identified using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 8)

-->
Probe request frames from the access point can be identified using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 4)

-->
Probe response frames from the access point can be identified using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 5)

-->
The authentication process between the client and the access point can be observed using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 11)

-->
After the authentication process is complete, the station's association request can be viewed using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0)

-->
The access point's association response can be viewed using the following Wireshark filter:

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 1)

-->
If the example network uses WPA2, the EAPOL (handshake) frames can be viewed using the following Wireshark filter:

eapol

-->
Once the connection process is complete, the termination of the connection can be viewed by identifying which party (client or access point) initiated the disconnection. This can be done using the following Wireshark filter to capture Disassociation frames (10) or Deauthentication frames (12).

(wlan.fc.type == 0) && (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 12) or (wlan.fc.type_subtype == 10)
