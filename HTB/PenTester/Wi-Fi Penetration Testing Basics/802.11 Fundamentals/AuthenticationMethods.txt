There are two primary authentication systems commonly used in WiFi networks:
Open System Authentication and Shared Key Authentication.

Open System Authentication is straightforward and does not require any shared secret or credentials for initial access. 

Shared Key Authentication, as the name suggests, involves the use of a shared key. 

While many other methods exist, especially in Enterprise environments or with advanced protocols like WPA3 and Enhanced Open, these two are the most prevalent.

___________________________________

Open System Authentication

This authentication type is commonly found for open networks that do not require a password. For Open System Authentication, it tends to follow this order:

The client (station) sends an authentication request to the access point to begin the authentication process.
The access point then sends the client back an authentication response, which indicates whether the authentication was accepted.
The client then sends the access point an association request.
The access point then responds with an association response to indicate whether the client can stay connected.

___________________________________

Shared Key Authentication

In this authentication system, the client and access point prove their identities through the computation of a challenge.
This method is often associated with Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) and Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA).
It provides a basic level of security through the use of a pre-shared key.

-->
Authentication with WEP
Authentication request: Initially, as it goes, the client sends the access point an authentication request.
Challenge: The access point then responds with a custom authentication response which includes challenge text for the client.
Challenge Response: The client then responds with the encrypted challenge, which is encrypted with the WEP key.
Verification: The AP then decrypts this challenge and sends back either an indication of success or failure.

-->
Authentication with WPA
On the flip side, WPA utilizes a form of authentication that includes a four-way handshake. Commonly, this replaces the association process with more verbose verification, and in the case of WPA3, the authentication portion is even crazier for the pairwise key generation. From a high level, this is performed like the following.

Authentication Request: The client sends an authentication request to the AP to initiate the authentication process.
Authentication Response: The AP responds with an authentication response, which indicates that it is ready to proceed with authentication.
Pairwise Key Generation: The client and the AP then calculate the PMK from the PSK (password).
Four-Way Handshake: The client and access point then undergo each step of the four way handshake, which involves nonce exchange, derivation, among other actions to verify that the client and AP truly know the PSK.

-->
Authentication with WPA3

One of its key features is Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which replaces the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) method used in WPA2, providing better protection for passwords and individual data sessions.

----
Legacy access points (802.11ac Wave-1 or older) will not support WPA3/MR 27+; if configured with an SSID that uses WPA3, the APs will encrypt traffic using WPA2. 
----

Cisco Meraki supports two WPA3 modes:

WPA3-Personal
WPA3-Enterprise

WPA3-Personal
WPA3-Personal using Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) builds upon WPA2 PSK, where users can authenticate using a passphrase only.

SAE adds a layer of security by authenticating both the STA and Meraki AP even before having an Association Request/Response. This provides an advantage when using non-complex passphrases. SAE is a variant of RFC 7664, the Dragonfly Key Exchange.

WPA3-Personal has two variants:

WPA3 Only 
WPA3 Transition Mode

___________________________________

WPA3 Only

When using WPA3 only, the access point will transmit in the beacon the capability to only accept STA using WPA3 SAE. When using transition mode,
the access point will broadcast in the beacon capabilities to accept STA using both WPA2 and WPA3.

WPA3 SAE follows the following process:

1.Probe Request
Regular request to AP after beacon.

2.Probe Response
Regular response to STA.

3.Authentication (Commit) from STA to AP
This packet is an 802.11 authentication frame.
Commit will include SAE authentication Seq Number 1 with a scalar and an element not related to the password to be used.
This is used to generate the PMK on the STA.

4.Authentication (Commit) from AP to STA
This packet is an 802.11 authentication frame.
Commit will include SAE authentication Seq Number 1 with a scalar and an element not related to the password to be used.
This is used to generate the PMK on the AP.

5.Authentication (Confirm) from STA to AP
This packet is an 802.11 authentication frame.
Confirm includes Seq Number 2 with confirm message with key generated for AP to validate.

6.Authentication (Confirm) from AP to STA
This packet is an 802.11 authentication frame.
Confirm includes Seq Number 2 with confirm message with key generated letting STA know the key is correct or rejecting the authentication.

7.Regular Association Request

8.Regular Association Response

9.4-way handshake utilizing PMK generated with SAE method. After this step regular data can be transmitted

___________________________________

WPA3 Transition Mode

WPA3 SAE has a transition mode (sometimes called mixed mode) created to allow WPA2 clients to co-exist on the same SSID used for WPA3.
Although WPA3 needs to have Management Frame Protection (MFP/802.11w) set to Required

Client Behavior Chart for WPA3 Personal
The following chart delineates the different connection behaviors of STA based on the dashboard configuration:

Dashboard       Configuration	        Client behavior
WPA3	        802.11w PMF	            WPA2 STA	    WPA2 STA PMF	WPA3 STA
Only	        Required	            Cannot Connect	Cannot Connect	Connects
Transition

                Required	            Cannot Connect	Connects	    Connects
                Enabled	                Connects	    Connects	    Connects

Client Behavior Chart for WPA3 Personal
The following chart delineates the different connection behaviors of STA based on the dashboard configuration:

Modes of operation
WPA3 Enterprise has two modes of operation available on dashboard to meet the network requirements as needed

1.WPA3 Only 
This mode uses the same ciphers as WPA2, but requires 802.11w (PMF) to be enabled.

2.WPA3 192-bit  
This mode utilizes 192-bit security while still using the 802.1X standard to provide a secure wireless network for enterprise use.
This provides a superior encryption method to better protect any kind of data.

WPA3 192-bit security will be exclusive for EAP-TLS, which will require certificates on both the supplicant and RADIUS server. Also, to use WPA3 192-bit enterprise, the RADIUS servers must use one of the permitted EAP ciphers:

TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

___________________________________

WPA3-Enterprise 192-bit follows a similar process as the one in WPA2, however, it is enhanced due to the aforementioned ciphers.

The WPA3 192-bit process is the following:

1.Regular Probe Request from STA to AP
2.Probe Response will include RSN SHA384 Suite-b stating this is WPA3 enterprise with 192-bit security
3.Regular 802.11 Authentication with SEQ 1 from STA to AP
4.Regular 802.11 Authentication with SEQ 2 from AP to STA
5.Association Request including RSN capabilities from STA to AP
6.Association Response from AP to STA
7.EAP process that will include Identity Request/Response and exchange of credentials with RADIUS server using EAP-TLS protocol
8.If authentication is complete with RADIUS server it will send an Access-Accept message which will be transmitted to the STA from the AP as a "Success" message
9.Finally, based on EAP process a PMK will be created and 4-way handshake will generate valid keys to ensure encryption. After this step, regular data can be transmitted

___________________________________
WPA3 192-bit is not supported with Meraki Cloud Authentication. So....

Opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE)
Opportunistic wireless encryption (OWE) provides a secure integration for clients without requesting the user to input credentials or a password.

Detailed in RFC 8110, OWE offers clients protection similar to SAE.

___________________________________

WPA3 and 6 GHz
6 GHz SSIDs only support the use of WPA3, this means that transition mode will not be supported. Therefore,
if a configuration that is not supported on the SSID is implemented, 6 GHz will be turned off by default.


Compatibility Configuration:

Security Type:              2.4/5 GHz       6 GHz

Open                        ON              OFF

OWE*                        ON              ON

OWE* Transition             ON              OFF

WPA2 Personal               ON              OFF

WPA2 Enterprise             ON              OFF

WPA3 Transition Mode for RADIUS Authentication

WPA3 Transition mode for 802.1X enables clients to connect to a single SSID with dynamic encryption.
This is done by using WPA2 for 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, while using WPA3 for 6 GHz radio. This allows Wi-Fi 5, 6 and 6E clients to connect to the same broadcasting SSID configured for RADIUS-based authentication.
With WPA3 Transition Mode, clients can roam between WPA2 enterprise and WPA3 enterprise SSIDs.
When a client roams from a WPA2 to WPA3 SSID reauthentication will take place, but with minimal disruption to connectivity.
