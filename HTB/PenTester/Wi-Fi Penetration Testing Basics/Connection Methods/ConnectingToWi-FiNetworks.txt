Connecting to Wi-Fi networks using Linux involves a few straightforward steps.

Using CLI

To connect to a network via the command line,
we would use wpa_supplicant along with a configuration file that contains the necessary network details.

we can utilize the iwlist tool along with some grep parameters to filter and display useful information like the cell, signal quality, ESSID, and IEEE version of the networks around us.
Cmd:
sudo iwlist wlan0 s | grep 'Cell\|Quality\|ESSID\|IEEE'

Connecting to WEP Networks

We just need to provide the SSID, the WEP hex key
and set the WEP key index using wep_tx_keyidx in a configuration file (e.g., wep.conf) to establish the connection.

Additionally, we set key_mgmt=NONE, which is used for WEP or networks with no security.


Code--->
network={
	ssid="HackTheBox"
    key_mgmt=NONE
    wep_key0=3C1C3A3BAB
    wep_tx_keyidx=0
}
--->
Once the configuration file is ready, we can use wpa_supplicant to connect to the network.
We run the command with the -c option to specify the configuration file and the -i option to specify the network interface.
Cmd:
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wep.conf -i wlan0

After connecting, we can obtain an IP address by using the dhclient utility.
Cmd:
sudo dhclient wlan0

Connecting to WPA Personal Networks

we'll need to create a wpa_supplicant configuration file (eg: wpa.conf) with the correct PSK (Pre-Shared Key) and SSID. 

This file will look like the following:
Code--->
network={
	ssid="HackMe"
    psk="password123"
}
--->

Then we could initiate our wpa connection to the AP using the following command.
Cmd:
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wpa.conf -i wlan0

After connecting, we can obtain an IP address by using the dhclient utility.


--////---
Note:
If the network uses WPA3 instead of WPA2, we would need to add key_mgmt=SAE to our wpa_supplicant configuration file to connect to it.
This setting specifies the use of the Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) protocol, which is a key component of WPA3 security.

_____________________________
Connecting to WPA Enterprise

If the target network uses WPA/WPA2 Enterprise (MGT),
we'll need to create a wpa_supplicant configuration file with the correct identity, password, SSID and key_mgmt.
This file will look like this:
Code--->
network={
  ssid="HTB-Corp"
  key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
  identity="HTB\Administrator"
  password="Admin@123"
}
--->

Once the configuration file is ready, we can use wpa_supplicant to connect to the network.
We run the command with the -c option to specify the configuration file and the -i option to specify the network interface.

Cmd:
sudo wpa_supplicant -c wpa_enterprsie.conf -i wlan0

After connecting, we can obtain an IP address by using the dhclient utility.

Connecting with Network Manager Utilities

This utility will give us a somewhat graphical perspective while connecting to these wireless networks.
Cmd:
sudo nmtui

If we select Activate a connection, we should be able to choose from a list of wireless networks.
