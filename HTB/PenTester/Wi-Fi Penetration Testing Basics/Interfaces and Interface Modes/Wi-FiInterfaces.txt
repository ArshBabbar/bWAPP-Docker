How to Choose the Right Interface for the Job:

1.IEEE 802.11ac or IEEE 802.11ax support
2.Supports at least monitor mode and packet injection

The chipset of a Wi-Fi card and its driver are crucial factors in penetration testing,
as it is important to select a chipset that supports both monitor mode and packet injection.

Interface Strength

Much of wi-fi penetration testing comes down to our physical positioning.

we might want to shoot for longer range cards. One of the ways that we can check on this is through the iwconfig utility.

By default, this is set to the country specified in our operating system. We can check on this with the iw reg get command in Linux.

Most of the time, this might be DFS-UNSET, which is not helpful for us since it limits our cards to 20 dBm.

Changing the Region Settings for our Interface

Suppose we lived in the United States, we might want to change our interfaces region accordingly.
We could do so with the iw reg set command, and simply change the US to our region's two letter code.

Cmd: 
Random0@htb[/htb]$ sudo iw reg set US

Then, we could check this setting again with the iw reg get command.

Afterwards, we can check the txpower of our interface with the iwconfig utility.

Then, we can set the desired txpower for our interface with the iwconfig utility.
Cmd:
sudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 30

Checking Driver Capabilities for our Interface

we can check on these capabilities via the command line.
Cmd:
iw list

Of course, this output can be lengthy, but all the information in here is pertinent to our testing efforts. From the above example, we know that this interface supports the following.

Almost all pertinent regular ciphers
Both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands
Mesh networks and IBSS capabilities
P2P peering
SAE aka WPA3 authentication

Scanning Available WiFi Networks

we can use the iwlist command along with the specific interface name.
Given the potentially extensive output of this command, it is beneficial to filter the results to show only the most relevant information.
This can be achieved by piping the output through grep to include only lines containing Cell, Quality, ESSID, or IEEE.

Example:
iwlist wlan0 scan |  grep 'Cell\|Quality\|ESSID\|IEEE'

From the refined output of the iwlist command, we can identify that there are three available WiFi networks.
This filtered information focuses on the critical details such as the network cells, signal quality, ESSID, and IEEE specifications,
making it straightforward to analyze the available networks.

Changing Channel & Frequency of Interface

We can use the following command to see all available channels for the wireless interface:
Cmd:
iwlist wlan0 channel

First, we need to disable the wireless interface which ensures that the interface is not in use and can be safely reconfigured.
Then we can set the desired channel using the iwconfig command and finally, re-enable the wireless interface.

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 channel 64
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
iwlist wlan0 channel

By following these steps, we can effectively change the channel of the wireless interface to optimize performance and reduce interference.

If we prefer to change the frequency directly rather than adjusting the channel, we have the option to do so as well.
Cmd:
iwlist wlan0 frequency | grep Current

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 freq "5.52G"
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up

We can now verify the current frequency, and this time, we can see that the frequency has been successfully changed to 5.52 GHz.
This change automatically adjusted the channel to the appropriate channel 104

we can set the desired frequency using the iwconfig command and finally, re-enable the wireless interface.
Cmd:
sudo iwconfig wlan0 freq "5.52G"
