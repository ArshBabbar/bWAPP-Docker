1.Managed Mode:
Managed mode is when we want our interface to act as a client or a station.
In other words, this mode allows us to authenticate and associate to an access point, basic service set, and others.

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode managed
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid HTB-Wifi
sudo iwconfig

2.Ad-hoc Mode:
this mode is peer to peer and allows wireless interfaces to communicate directly to one another.
That is their band that is utilized for AP-to-AP communications and range extension.
this mode is not extender mode, as in most cases that is actually two interfaces bridged together.

sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode ad-hoc
sudo iwconfig wlan0 essid HTB-Mesh
sudo iwconfig
___________________________________

3.Master Mode:
On the flip side of managed mode is master mode (access point/router mode).
However, we cannot simply set this with the iwconfig utility. Rather, we need what is referred to as a management daemon.
This management daemon is responsible for responding to stations or clients connecting to our network.

nano open.conf
sudo hostapd open.conf

4.Mesh Mode:
Mesh mode is an interesting one in which we can set our interface to join a self-configuring and routing network.
This mode is commonly used for business applications where there is a need for large coverage across a physical space.
|We can provide additional configuration to make it functional, but generally speaking,
|we can see if it is possible by whether or not we are greeted with errors after running the following commands.

sudo iw dev wlan0 set type mesh
sudo iwconfig

5.Monitor Mode:
Monitor mode, also known as promiscuous mode, is a specialized operating mode for wireless network interfaces.
In this mode, the network interface can capture all wireless traffic within its range, regardless of the intended recipient
|Unlike normal operation, where the interface only captures packets addressed to it or broadcasted, monitor mode enables comprehensive network monitoring and analysis.
|Enabling monitor mode typically requires administrative privileges and may vary depending on the operating system and wireless chipset used. 

sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iw wlan0 set monitor control
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
iwconfig

it is important to make sure our interface supports whatever mode is pertinent to our testing efforts. If we are attempting to exploit
WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3,and all enterprise variants, we are likely sufficient with just monitor mode and packet injection capabilities.
However, suppose we were trying to achieve different actions we might consider the following capabilities.

|Employing a Rogue AP or Evil-Twin Attack: - We would want our interface to support master mode with a management daemon like
hostapd, hostapd-mana, hostapd-wpe, airbase-ng, and others.

|Backhaul and Mesh or Mesh-Type system exploitation: - We would want to make sure our interface supports ad-hoc and mesh modes accordingly.
For this kind of exploitation we are normally sufficient with monitor mode and packet injection,
but the extra capabilities can allow us to perform node impersonation among others.
