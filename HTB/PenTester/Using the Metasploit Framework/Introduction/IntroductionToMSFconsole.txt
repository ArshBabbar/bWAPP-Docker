To start interacting with the Metasploit Framework, we need to type msfconsole in the terminal of our choice.

__________________________________________
Preparation

Upon launching the msfconsole, we are met with their coined splash art and the command line prompt, waiting for our first command.
One of the first things we need to do is make sure the modules that compose the framework are up to date, and any new ones available to the public can be imported.

Installing MSF
sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework

MSF Engagement Structure
The MSF engagement structure can be divided into five main categories.

Enumeration
Preparation
Exploitation
Privilege Escalation
Post-Exploitation
