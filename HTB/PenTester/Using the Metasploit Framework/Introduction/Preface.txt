Discipline is critical in all fields of work, and the conclusions are as follows:

We will never have enough time to complete the assessment.
With the number of technologies in use in every single environment variation, we will not be offered the time to do a complete, comprehensive assessment.
Time is money, and we are on the clock for a non-tech-savvy customer, and we need to complete the bulk of the work first: the issues with the most potential impact and highest remediation turnover.

Credibility can be an issue even if we make our tools or manually exploit every service.
We are not competing against other industry members but rather against pre-set economic conditions and personal beliefs from the customer management level.
They would not comprehend or give much importance to accolades.
They just want the work done in the highest possible quantity, in the least amount of time.

You only have to impress yourself, not the infosec community.
If we achieve the first, the latter will come naturally. Using the same example as above, many artists with an online presence stray from their original goals in pursuit of online validation.
Their art becomes stale and generic to the keen eye, but to the everyday user, it contains the wanted visual elements and themes, not those their followers do not yet know they want.
As security researchers or penetration testers, we only must validate vulnerabilities, not validate our ego.

Conclusion

We have to analyze and know our tools inside and out to keep our tracks covered and avoid a cataclysmic event during our assessment.

Do not get tunnel vision. Use the tool as a tool, not as a backbone or life support for our complete assessment.
