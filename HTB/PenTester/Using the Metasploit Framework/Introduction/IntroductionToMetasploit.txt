The Metasploit Project is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute the exploit code.

The Metasploit Framework includes a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection.

the Metasploit Project is a collection of commonly used tools that provide a complete environment for penetration testing and exploit development.

Metasploit Pro
Metasploit as a product is split into two versions.
The Metasploit Pro version is different from the Metasploit Framework one with some additional features:

Task Chains
Social Engineering
Vulnerability Validations
GUI
Quick Start Wizards
Nexpose Integration

Metasploit Framework Console
The msfconsole is probably the most popular interface to the Metasploit Framework (MSF).
It provides an "all-in-one" centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all options available in the MSF.
Msfconsole may seem intimidating at first, but once you learn the syntax of the commands, you will learn to appreciate the power of utilizing this interface.

The features that msfconsole generally brings are the following:
1.It is the only supported way to access most of the features within Metasploit
2.Provides a console-based interface to the Framework
3.Contains the most features and is the most stable MSF interface
4.Full readline support, tabbing, and command completion
5.Execution of external commands in msfconsole

Understanding the Architecture

It is essential not to have
any wildcards that might leave you or your client exposed to data breaches -->https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2016/09/28/cobalt-strike-rce-active-exploitation-reported/

By default, all the base files related to Metasploit Framework can be found under /usr/share/metasploit-framework in our ParrotOS Security distro.


Data, Documentation, Lib
These are the base files for the Framework. The Data and Lib are the functioning parts of the msfconsole interface, while the Documentation folder contains all the technical details about the project.

1.Modules
The Modules detailed above are split into separate categories in this folder. We will go into detail about these in the next sections. They are contained in the following folders:
Path:
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules

2.Plugins
Plugins offer the pentester more flexibility when using the msfconsole since they can easily be manually or automatically loaded as needed to provide extra functionality and automation during our assessment.
Path:
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/

3.Scripts
Meterpreter functionality and other useful scripts.
Path:
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/

4.Tools
Command-line utilities that can be called directly from the msfconsole menu.
Path:
/usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/
