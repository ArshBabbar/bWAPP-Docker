A Payload in Metasploit refers to a module that aids the exploit module in (typically) returning a shell to the attacker. 

There are three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: Singles, Stagers, and Stages.

For example, windows/shell_bind_tcp is a single payload with no stage, whereas windows/shell/bind_tcp consists of a stager (bind_tcp) and a stage (shell).

Singles

A Single payload contains the exploit and the entire shellcode for the selected task.
Inline payloads are by design more stable than their counterparts because they contain everything all-in-one. 
Singles are self-contained payloads.
They are the sole object sent and executed on the target system, getting us a result immediately after running.

Stagers

Stager payloads work with Stage payloads to perform a specific task.
A Stager is waiting on the attacker machine, ready to establish a connection to the victim host once the stage completes its run on the remote host.
Stagers are typically used to set up a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable.

Stages

Stages are payload components that are downloaded by stager's modules.
The various payload Stages provide advanced features with no size limits, such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and others.
