Targets are unique operating system identifiers taken from the versions of those specific operating systems which adapt the selected exploit module to run on that particular version of the operating system. 


in simple show targets is used to see how many system(versions) of any particular app or survice are exploitable to the payload
for example using blueromance to attack windows SMB(server message block) on port 445 
we can confirm this by going into exploit blueromance and typing show targets to see what versions of SMB are weak to attack.
