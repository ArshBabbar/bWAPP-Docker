Every operating system has a shell, and to interact with it, we must use an application known as a terminal emulator.
Here are some of the most common terminal emulators:

Terminal Emulator 	Operating System
Windows Terminal 	Windows
cmder 	            Windows
PuTTY 	            Windows
kitty 	            Windows, Linux and MacOS
Alacritty 	        Windows, Linux and MacOS
xterm 	            Linux
GNOME Terminal 	    Linux
MATE Terminal 	    Linux
Konsole 	        Linux
Terminal 	        MacOS
iTerm2 	            MacOS

Command Language Interpreters

Much like a human language interpreter will translate spoken or sign language in real-time,
a command language interpreter is a program working to interpret the instructions provided by the user
and issue the tasks to the operating system for processing.

So when we discuss command-line interfaces,
we know it is a combination of the operating system, terminal emulator application, and the command language interpreter. 

Many different command language interpreters can be used
some of which are also called shell scripting languages or Command and Scripting interpreters
as defined in the Execution techniques of the MITRE ATT&CK Matrix.
