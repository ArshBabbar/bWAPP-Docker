A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another.
This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers.

_______________________________________
Process:

1.Zone Transfer Request (AXFR): The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server.

2.SOA Record Transfer: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its Start of Authority (SOA) record.
 The SOA record contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.

3.DNS Records Transmission: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one.

4.Zone Transfer Complete: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer.

5.Acknowledgement (ACK): The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data.

The Zone Transfer Vulnerability

a misconfigured DNS server can transform this process into a significant security vulnerability.
The core issue lies in the access controls governing who can initiate a zone transfer.


The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

    Subdomains: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
    IP Addresses: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
    Name Server Records: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

Remediation

Fortunately, awareness of this vulnerability has grown, and most DNS server administrators have mitigated the risk.
Modern DNS servers are typically configured to allow zone transfers only to trusted secondary servers, ensuring that sensitive zone data remains confidential.

Exploiting Zone Transfers

You can use the dig command to request a zone transfer:
Cmd:
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me

This command instructs dig to request a full zone transfer (axfr) from the DNS server responsible for zonetransfer.me.
