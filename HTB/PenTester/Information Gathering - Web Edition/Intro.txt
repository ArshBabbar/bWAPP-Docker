Web Reconnaissance is the foundation of a thorough security assessment.
It forms a critical part of the "Information Gathering" phase of the Penetration Testing Process.

________________________________________
The primary goals of web reconnaissance include:

1.Identifying Assets: Uncovering all publicly accessible components of the target, such as web pages, subdomains, IP addresses, and technologies used.

2.Discovering Hidden Information: Locating sensitive information that might be inadvertently exposed, including backup files, configuration files, or internal documentation.

3.Analysing the Attack Surface: Examining the target's attack surface to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

4.Gathering Intelligence: Collecting information that can be leveraged for further exploitation or social engineering attacks.

Types of Reconnaissance

1.Active Reconnaissance
In active reconnaissance, the attacker directly interacts with the target system to gather information.

This interaction can take various forms:

Technique	            Description	                                                 Tools	                                Risk of Detection
Port Scanning	        Identifying open ports and services running on the target.	Nmap, Masscan, Unicornscan	            High: Direct interaction with the target can trigger intrusion detection systems (IDS) and firewalls.

Vulnerability Scanning	Probing the target for known vulnerabilities, such as       Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto                  High: Vulnerability scanners send exploit payloads that security solutions can detect.
                        outdated software or misconfigurations.	           

Network Mapping	        Mapping the target's network topology,	                    Traceroute, Nmap	                    Medium to High: Excessive or unusual network traffic can raise suspicion.
                        including connected devices and their relationships.

Banner Grabbing	        Retrieving information from banners 	                	Netcat, curl	                        Low: Banner grabbing typically involves minimal interaction but can still be logged.
                        displayed by services running on the target.

OS Fingerprinting	    Identifying the operating system running on the target.	    Nmap, Xprobe2	                        Low: OS fingerprinting is usually passive, but some advanced techniques can be detected.

Service Enumeration	    Determining the specific versions of services 	            Nmap	                                Low: Similar to banner grabbing, service enumeration can be logged but is less likely to trigger alerts.
                        running on open ports.

Web Spidering	        Crawling the target website to identify 	                Burp Suite Spider, OWASP ZAP Spider,	Low to Medium: Can be detected if the crawler's behaviour is not carefully configured to mimic legitimate traffic.
                        web pages, directories, and files.                          Scrapy (customisable)

2.Passive Reconnaissance
In contrast, passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about the target without directly interacting with it. This relies on analysing publicly available information and resources, such as:

Technique	            Description	                                	                        Tools	                                        Risk of Detection
Search Engine Queries	Utilising search engines to uncover information about the target	    Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, 	                    Very Low: Search engine queries are normal internet activity and unlikely to trigger alerts.
                        , including websites, social media profiles, and news articles.	        and specialised search engines (e.g., Shodan)

WHOIS Lookups	        Querying WHOIS databases to retrieve domain registration details.		whois command-line tool, 	                    Very Low: WHOIS queries are legitimate and do not raise suspicion.
                                                                                                online WHOIS lookup services

DNS	Analysing           DNS records to identify subdomains, mail servers etc.		            dig, nslookup, host, dnsenum, fierce, dnsrecon	Very Low: DNS queries are essential for internet browsing and are not typically flagged as suspicious.

Web Archive Analysis	Examining historical snapshots of the target's website		            Wayback Machine	                                Very Low: Accessing archived versions of websites is a normal activity.
                        to identify changes, vulnerabilities, or hidden information.

Social Media Analysis	Gathering information from social media platforms 		                LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook,                	Very Low: Accessing public social media profiles is not considered intrusive.
                        like LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook.                                    specialised OSINT tools

Code Repositories	    Analysing publicly accessible code repositories like	                GitHub, GitLab	                                Very Low: Code repositories are meant for public access, and searching them is not suspicious.
                        GitHub for exposed credentials or vulnerabilities.
