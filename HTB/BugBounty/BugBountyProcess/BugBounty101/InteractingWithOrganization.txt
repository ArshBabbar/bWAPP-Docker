Well, to begin with, do not interact with them.
Allow the security/triage team some time to process your report, validate your finding, and maybe ask questions. 

Once the security/triage team gets back to you, note the team member's username and tag them in any future communications since they will probably be dealing with your submission. Do not interact with the security/triage team through any unofficial communication channel (social media etc.)!

During your interaction with the security/triage team, there could be disagreements about the severity of the bug or the bounty. A bug's impact and severity play a significant role during the bounty amount assignment. In the case of such a disagreement, proceed as follows.

Explain your rationale for choosing this severity score and guide the security/triage team through each metric value you specified in the CVSS calculator. Eventually, you will come to an agreement.
Go over the bug bounty program's policy and scope and ensure that your submission complies with both. Also, make sure that the bounty amount resembles the policy of the bug bounty program.
If none of the above was fruitful, contact mediation or a similar platform service.
