What Is A SIEM Use Case?

Utilizing SIEM use cases is a fundamental aspect of crafting a robust cybersecurity strategy, as they enable the effective identification and detection of potential security incidents.

Use cases are designed to illustrate specific situations where a product or service can be applied, and they can range from general scenarios, such as failed login attempts, to more complex ones like detecting a ransomware outbreak.

SIEM Use Case Development Lifecycle

The following critical stages must be considered when developing any use cases:

1.Requirements:
 Comprehend the purpose or necessity of the use case, pinpointing the specific scenario for which an alert or notification is needed.

2.Data Points:
 Identify all data points within the network where a user account can be used to log in.

3.Log Validation:
 Verify and validate the logs, ensuring they contain all crucial information such as user, timestamp, source, destination, machine name and application name.

4.Design and Implementation:
 After identifying and verifying all logs with different data points and sources, begin designing the use case by defining the conditions under which an alert should be triggered.

5.Documentation:
 Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) detail the standard processes analysts must follow when working on alerts.

6.Onboarding:
 Start with the development stage before moving the alert directly into the production environment.

7.Periodic Update/Fine-tuning:
 Obtain regular feedback from analysts and maintain up-to-date correlation rules by whitelisting.

How To Build SIEM Use Cases

1.Comprehend your needs, risks, and establish alerts for monitoring all necessary systems accordingly.

2.Determine the priority and impact, then map the alert to the kill chain or MITRE framework.

3.Establish the Time to Detection (TTD) and Time to Response (TTR) for the alert to assess the SIEM's effectiveness and analysts' performance.

4.Create a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for managing alerts.

5.Outline the process for refining alerts based on SIEM monitoring.

6.Develop an Incident Response Plan (IRP) to address true positive incidents.

7.Set Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Operational Level Agreements (OLAs) between teams for handling alerts and following the IRP.

8.Implement and maintain an audit process for managing alerts and incident reporting by analysts.

9.Create documentation to review the logging status of machines or systems, the basis for creating alerts, and their triggering frequency.

10.Establish a knowledge base document for essential information and updates to case management tools.
