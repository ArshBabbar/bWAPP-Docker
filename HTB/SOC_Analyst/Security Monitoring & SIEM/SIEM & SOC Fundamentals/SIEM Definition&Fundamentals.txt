What Is SIEM?

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) encompasses the utilization of software offerings and solutions that merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events.
These instruments facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications.

The Evolution Of SIEM Technology

The acronym "SIEM" emerged from the collaboration of two Gartner analysts who suggested a novel security information framework that integrated two preceding technologies: Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM).

First-generation SIM technology was developed upon conventional log collection management systems, allowing for extended storage, examination, and reporting of log data while incorporating logs with threat intelligence.
Second-generation SEM technology tackled security events by delivering consolidation, correlation, and notification of events from a range of security apparatuses, such as antivirus software, firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), in addition to events disclosed directly by authentication, SNMP traps, servers, and databases.

How Does A SIEM Solution Work?

SIEM systems function by gathering data from a variety of sources, including PCs, network devices, servers, and more.
This data is then standardized and consolidated to facilitate ease of analysis.

SIEM Business Requirements & Use Cases

1.Log Aggregation & Normalization:
 Log consolidation entails gathering terabytes of security information from vital firewalls, confidential databases, and essential applications. 

2.Threat Alerting
 Having a SIEM solution that can identify and notify IT security teams about possible threats within the vast volume of collected security event data is essential. 

3.Contextualization & Response
 Contextualization enables IT security teams to identify genuine potential threats and act swiftly. Automated configuration processes can filter some contextualized threats, reducing the number of alerts received by the team.

4.Compliance
 SIEM solutions play a significant role in compliance by assisting organizations in meeting regulatory requirements through a comprehensive approach to threat detection and management.

Data Flows Within A SIEM

Let us now briefly see how data travel within a SIEM, until they are ready for analysis.

1.SIEM solutions ingest logs from various data sources. Each SIEM tool possesses unique capabilities for collecting logs from different sources. This process is known as data ingestion or data collection.

2.The gathered data is processed and normalized to be understood by the SIEM correlation engine. The raw data must be written or read in a format that can be comprehended by the SIEM and converted into a common format from various types of datasets. This process is called data normalization and data aggregation.

3.Finally, the most crucial part of SIEM, where SOC teams utilize the normalized data collected by the SIEM to create various detection rules, dashboards, visualizations, alerts, and incidents. This enables the SOC team to identify potential security risks and respond swiftly to security incidents.
