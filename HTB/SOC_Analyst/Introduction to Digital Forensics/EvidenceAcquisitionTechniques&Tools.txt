Forensic Imaging

Forensic imaging is a fundamental process in digital forensics that involves creating an exact, bit-by-bit copy of digital storage media, such as hard drives, solid-state drives, USB drives, and memory cards.
Below are some forensic imaging tools and solutions:

1.FTK Imager: Developed by AccessData (now acquired by Exterro), FTK Imager is one of the most widely used disk imaging tools in the cybersecurity field.

2.AFF4 Imager: A free, open-source tool crafted for creating and duplicating forensic disk images.

3.DD and DCFLDD: Both are command-line utilities available on Unix-based systems (including Linux and MacOS).

4.Virtualization Tools: Given the prevalent use of virtualization in modern systems, incident responders will often need to collect evidence from virtual environments.
