Incident Handling Definition & Scope

Incident handling (IH) has become an important part of an organization's defensive capability against cybercrime.

An event is an action occurring in a system or network. Examples of events are:

A user sending an email
A mouse click
A firewall allowing a connection request

An incident is an event with a negative consequence. One example of an incident is a system crash.

_________________________________
We define an IT security incident as an event with a clear intent to cause harm that is performed against a computer system.
Examples of incidents are:
Data theft
Funds theft
Unauthorized access to data
Installation and usage of malware and remote access tools

Incident handling is a clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment.

It is important to note that incident handling is not limited to intrusion incidents alone.

Other types of incidents, such as those caused by malicious insiders, availability issues, and loss of intellectual property, also fall within the scope of incident handling.
A comprehensive incident handling plan should address various types of incidents and provide appropriate measures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them to restore normal business operations as quickly and efficiently as possible.

Incident Handling's Value & Generic Notes

IT security incidents frequently involve the compromise of personal and business data, and it is therefore crucial to respond quickly and effectively.
A great benefit of having an incident handling team (often referred to as an incident response team) handle events is that a trained workforce will respond systematically, and therefore appropriate actions will be taken.

One of the most widely used resources on incident handling is 

NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. -->https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf

The document aims to assist organizations in mitigating the risks from computer security incidents by providing practical guidelines on responding to incidents effectively and efficiently.

Cyber Kill Chain

Before we start talking about handling incidents, we need to understand the attack lifecycle (a.k.a. the cyber kill chain).
This lifecycle describes how attacks manifest themselves. Understanding this lifecycle will provide us with valuable insights on
how far in the network an attacker is and what they may have access to during the investigation phase of an incident.

The cyber kill chain consists of seven (7) different stages:

1.Recon:
 it involves the part where an attacker chooses their target.
 Additionally,the attacker then performs information gathering to become more familiar with the target and gathers as much useful data as possible

2.Weaponization:
  the malware to be used for initial access is developed and embedded into some type of exploit or deliverable payload.

3.Deliver:
 the exploit or payload is delivered to the victim(s). 

4.Exploit:
 the moment when an exploit or a delivered payload is triggered.
 the attacker typically attempts to execute code on the target system in order to gain access or control.

5.Install:
 the initial stager is executed and is running on the compromised machine.
 Some common techniques used in the installation stage include:
 Droppers:
  A dropper is a small piece of code that is designed to install malware on the system and execute it.
 Backdoors:
  A backdoor is a type of malware that is designed to provide the attacker with ongoing access to the compromised system.
 Rootkits:
  A rootkit is a type of malware that is designed to hide its presence on a compromised system.

6.command and control(C&C):
 the attacker establishes a remote access capability to the compromised machine.

7.Action:

It is important to understand that adversaries won't operate in a linear manner (like the cyber kill chain shows).
Some previous cyber kill chain stages will be repeated over and over again.

Our objective is to stop an attacker from progressing further up the kill chain, ideally in one of the earliest stages.
