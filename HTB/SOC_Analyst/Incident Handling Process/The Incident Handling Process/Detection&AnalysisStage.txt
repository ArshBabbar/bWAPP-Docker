The detection & analysis phase involves all aspects of detecting an incident, such as utilizing sensors, logs, and trained personnel.
It also includes information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence.

Threats are introduced to the organization via an infinite amount of attack vectors, and their detection can come from sources such as:

An employee that notices abnormal behavior
An alert from one of our tools (EDR, IDS, Firewall, SIEM, etc.)
Threat hunting activities
A third-party notification informing us that they discovered signs of our organization being compromised

It is highly recommended to create levels of detection by logically categorizing our network as follows.

Detection at the network perimeter (using firewalls, internet-facing network intrusion detection/prevention systems, demilitarized zone, etc.)
Detection at the internal network level (using local firewalls, host intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.)
Detection at the endpoint level (using antivirus systems, endpoint detection & response systems, etc.)
Detection at the application level (using application logs, service logs, etc.)

___________________________
Initial Investigation

we should aim to collect as much information as possible at this stage about the following:

Date/Time when the incident was reported. Additionally, who detected the incident and/or who reported it?
How was the incident detected?
What was the incident? Phishing? System unavailability? etc.
Assemble a list of impacted systems (if relevant)
Document who has accessed the impacted systems and what actions have been taken. Make a note of whether this is an ongoing incident or the suspicious activity has been stopped
Physical location, operating systems, IP addresses and hostnames, system owner, system's purpose, current state of the system
(If malware is involved) List of IP addresses, time and date of detection, type of malware, systems impacted, export of malicious files with forensic information on them (such as hashes, copies of the files, etc.)

-->
during the investigative process later on, we will not necessarily uncover evidence in this time-sorted order.
However, when we sort the evidence based on when it occurred, 
we will get context from the separate events that took place.

Overall, the timeline should contain the information described in the following columns:

Date	Time of the event	hostname	event description	data source
-->
Incident Severity & Extent Questions
When handling a security incident, we should also try to answer the following questions to get an idea of the incident's severity and extent:

What is the exploitation impact?
What are the exploitation requirements?
Can any business-critical systems be affected by the incident?
Are there any suggested remediation steps?
How many systems have been impacted?
Is the exploit being used in the wild?
Does the exploit have any worm-like capabilities?
