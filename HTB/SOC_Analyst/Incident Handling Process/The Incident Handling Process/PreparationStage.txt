In the preparation stage, we have two separate objectives.
 The first one is the establishment of incident handling capability within the organization.
 The second is the ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing appropriate protective measures

_________________________________
Preparation Prerequisites
During the preparation, we need to ensure that we have:

Skilled incident handling team members (incident handling team members can be outsourced, but a basic capability and understanding of incident handling are necessary in-house regardless)
Trained workforce (as much as possible, through security awareness activities or other means of training)
Clear policies and documentation
Tools (software and hardware)

_________________________________
Clear Policies & Documentation
Some of the written policies and documentation should contain an up-to-date version of the following information:

Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members
Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law enforcement, internet service providers, facility management, and external incident response team
Incident response policy, plan, and procedures
Incident information sharing policy and procedures
Baselines of systems and networks, out of a golden image and a clean state environment
Network diagrams
Organization-wide asset management database
User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary (also to business-critical systems, which are handled with the skills needed to administer that specific system). These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users.
Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process (urgent purchase of up to a certain amount). The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of a $500 tool.
Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets

Tools (Software & Hardware)
Moving forward, we also need to ensure that we have the right tools to perform the job. These include, but are not limited to:

Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any restrictions (we know malware will be tested here, so tools such as antivirus should be disabled). These devices should be handled appropriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization.
Digital forensic image acquisition and analysis tools
Memory capture and analysis tools
Live response capture and analysis
Log analysis tools
Network capture and analysis tools
Network cables and switches
Write blockers
Hard drives for forensic imaging
Power cables
Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble hardware devices if needed
Indicator of Compromise (IOC) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
Chain of custody forms
Encryption software
Ticket tracking system
Secure facility for storage and investigation
Incident handling system independent of your organization's infrastructure

Many of the tools mentioned above will be part of what is known as a
 jump bag
always ready with the necessary tools to be picked up and leave immediately.

While protection is not necessarily the responsibility of an incident handling team,
any protection-related activities should be known to them to better understand the type and sophistication of an incident
and know where to look for artifacts/evidence, that could aid the investigation.

Let us now look at some of the highly recommended protective measures
which have a high mitigation impact against the majority of threats.

1.DMARC: -->https://dmarcly.com/blog/how-to-implement-dmarc-dkim-spf-to-stop-email-spoofing-phishing-the-definitive-guide#what-is-dmarc
 
 DMARC is an email protection against phishing built on top of the already existing SPF and DKIM. 

2.Endpoint Hardening (& EDR):

 . Some highly important actions (that actually work) to note and do something about are:

Disable LLMNR/NetBIOS
Implement LAPS and remove administrative privileges from regular users
Disable or configure PowerShell in "ConstrainedLanguage" mode
Enable Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules if using Microsoft Defender
Implement whitelisting. We know this is nearly impossible to implement. Consider at least blocking execution from user-writable folders (Downloads, Desktop, AppData, etc.). These are the locations where exploits and malicious payloads will initially find themselves. Remember to also block script types such as .hta, .vbs, .cmd, .bat, .js, and similar. Please pay attention to LOLBin files while implementing whitelisting. Do not overlook them; they are really used in the wild as initial access to bypass whitelisting.
Utilize host-based firewalls. As a bare minimum, block workstation-to-workstation communication and block outbound traffic to LOLBins
Deploy an EDR product. At this point in time, AMSI provides great visibility into obfuscated scripts for antimalware products to inspect the content before it gets executed. It is highly recommended that you only choose products that integrate with AMSI.
