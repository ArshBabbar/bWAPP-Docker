Just like the cyber kill chain, there are different stages, when responding to an incident, defined as the incident handling process. 

The incident handling process defines a capability for organizations to prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events. 

_________________________________
As defined by NIST, the incident handling process consists of the following four (4) distinct stages:

1.preparation
2.detection & analysis
3.investigating and recovering.
4.Post-incident activity

_________________________________

there should always be resources operating on the first two stages,
so that there is no disruption of preparation and detection capabilities

_________________________________

So, incident handling has two main activities, which are investigating and recovering. The investigation aims to:

Discover the initial 'patient zero' victim and create an (ongoing if still active) incident timeline
Determine what tools and malware the adversary used
Document the compromised systems and what the adversary has done

_________________________________
Investigation

The investigation starts based on the initially gathered (and limited) information that contain what we know about the incident so far. With this initial data, we will begin a 3-step cyclic process that will iterate over and over again as the investigation evolves. This process includes:

Creation and usage of indicators of compromise (IOC)
Identification of new leads and impacted systems
Data collection and analysis from the new leads and impacted systems

_________________________________
1.Initial Investigation Data
In order to reach a conclusion, an investigation should be based on valid leads that have been discovered not only during this initial phase but throughout the entire investigation process.

2.Creation & Usage Of IOCs
An indicator of compromise is a sign that an incident has occurred. IOCs are documented in a structured manner, which represents the artifacts of the compromise.

because IOCs are so important to an investigation, special languages such as OpenIOC have been developed to document them and share them in a standard manner.
Another widely used standard for IOCs is Yara.
There are a number of free tools that can be utilized, such as Mandiant's IOC Editor, to create or edit IOCs. 

3.To leverage IOCs, we will have to deploy an IOC-obtaining/IOC-searching tool (native or third party and possibly at scale).
A common approach is to utilize WMI or PowerShell for IOC-related operations in Windows environments.

4.Identification Of New Leads & Impacted Systems
After searching for IOCs, you expect to have some hits that reveal other systems with the same signs of compromise. 

5.Data Collection & Analysis From The New Leads & Impacted Systems
Once we have identified systems that included our IOCs, we will want to collect and preserve the state of those systems for further analysis in order to uncover new leads and/or answer investigative questions about the incident.
