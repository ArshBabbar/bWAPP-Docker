Installing Miniconda

-----Windows------

While the traditional installer works well, we can streamline the process on Windows using Scoop, a command-line installer for Windows.
Scoop simplifies the installation and management of various applications, including Miniconda.

First, install Scoop. Open PowerShell and run:
Cmd:
irm get.scoop.sh | iex

Next, add the extras bucket, which contains Miniconda:
scoop bucket add extras

Finally, install Miniconda with:
scoop install miniconda3

scoop install miniconda3
Cmd:
conda --version
