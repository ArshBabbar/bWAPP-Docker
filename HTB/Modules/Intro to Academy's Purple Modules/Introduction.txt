the Purple modules will allow for in-depth forensic analysis through detailed logging, traffic, and memory capturing, and a pre-installed DFIR toolset within each target after completing the attack part of each section.

The module is divided into two parts:

Windows Purple Module Targets
Linux Purple Module Targets
Each section of this module serves as a reference guide, empowering users to effectively access, configure, and manage critical logging and forensic mechanisms within the Purple module targets.

Purple Module Targets as Reusable Infrastructure

Blue Team Use Cases of Purple Module Targets:
1.Blue team professionals can transfer evidence from other compromised machines into Purple module targets for in-depth analysis, leveraging the built-in DFIR tools.
2.Blue team professionals can install vulnerable software of their choosing, simulate attacks on the software, and analyze the attack artifacts left behind, gaining practical insight into threat behaviors and identifying IOCs.
3.Blue team professionals can use the verbose logs and DFIR toolset of Purple module targets to develop and refine detection rules for identified IOCs.
4.Blue team professionals can use these targets to develop and validate threat hunting hypotheses by emulating attack chains and investigating the associated logs and system changes.
5.Blue team professionals can collect telemetry to reverse-engineer malware behavior in a controlled environment and design incident response playbooks.

Red Team Use Cases of Purple Module Targets:
1.Red team professionals can test custom-built or modified malware payloads to observe logs, process behavior, and other telemetry data. They can then use this data to refine methods and reduce detection opportunities.

Purple Team Use Cases of Purple Module Targets:
1.Both Blue and Red Teams can collaborate to simulate full attack-and-detect cycles, using the Purple module targets as the shared and controlled platform for learning and innovation.
