Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) represents a vital asset in our arsenal, providing essential insights to fortify our defenses against cyberattacks.
The primary objective of our CTI team is to transition our defense strategies from merely reactive measures to a more proactive, anticipatory stance.
They contribute crucial insights to our Security Operations Center (SOC).

Four fundamental principles make CTI an integral part of our cybersecurity strategy:
 1.Relevance
 2.Timeliness
 3.Actionability
 4.Accuracy

____________________________

When these four factors synergize, the intelligence gleaned allows us to:

Gain insights into potential adversary operations and campaigns that might be targeting our organization.
Enrich our data pool through analysis by CTI analysts and other network defenders.
Uncover adversary TTPs, enabling the development of effective mitigation measures and enhancing our understanding of adversary behavior.
Provide decision-makers within our organization with pertinent information for informed, impactful decision-making related to business operations.

The Difference Between Threat Intelligence & Threat Hunting:

Threat Intelligence (Predictive): The primary aim here is to anticipate the adversary's moves, ascertain their targets, and discern their methods of information acquisition. The adversary has a specific objective, and as a team involved in Threat Intelligence, our mission is to predict:

The location of the intended attack
The timing of the attack
The operational strategies the adversary will employ
The ultimate objectives of the adversary

Criteria Of Cyber Threat Intelligence:

This intelligence can then be classified into three different categories, each having varying degrees of relevance for different teams within our organization. These categories are:

Strategic Intelligence
Operational Intelligence
Tactical Intelligence

Strategic Intelligence is characterized by:

Being consumed by C-suite executives, VPs, and other company leaders
Aiming to align intelligence directly with company risks to inform decisions
Providing an overview of the adversary's operations over time
Mapping TTPs and Modus Operandi (MO) of the adversary
Striving to answer the Who? and Why?

Operational Intelligence is characterized by:

Also including TTPs of an adversary (similar to strategic intelligence)
Providing information on adversary campaigns
Offering more detail than what's found in strategic intelligence reports
Being produced for mid-level management personnel
Working towards answering the How? and Where?

Tactical Intelligence is characterized by:

Delivering immediate actionable information
Being provided to network defenders for swift action
Including technical details on attacks that have occurred or could occur in the near future
