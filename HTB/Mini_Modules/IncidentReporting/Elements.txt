Some Elements are :

Incident ID -->Unique identifier for the incident.
Incident Overview -->Provides a concise summary of the incident's events
Key Findings -->Enumerate any salient findings that emerge from the incident.
Immediate Action Taken --> Outline the Immediate responce measures taken.
Stakeholder Impact -->Assess the potential impact on various stakeholders.

-----Terms :
<<<<<---------
Technical Analysis :dissecting the events that transpired during the incident.
some key points to address:

1. Affected Systems & Data
2. Evidance Sources & Analysis
3. Indicators of Compromise(IOCs)
4. Root Cause Analysis
5. Technical Timeline:
-----Timeline should include:
[
    Reconnaissance,
    Initial Compromise,
    C2 Communications,
    Enumeration,
    Lateral Movement,
    Data Access & Exfiltration,
    Malware Deployment or Activity,
    Containment Times,
    Eradication Times,
    Recovery Times
]
------
6. Nature of attack -->TTPs(Tactics,techniques and procedures)

Response and Recovery Analysis

Breakdown of "Response and Recovery" typically includes:
_____

Immediate Response Actions
1.Revocation of Access
[
    Identification of Compromised Accounts/Systems,
    Timeframe,
    Method od Revocation,
    Impact
]
2.Containment Strategy
[
    Short-term Containment:immediate action taken to isolate affected systems

    Long-term Containment:Strategic measures,such as network segmentation or zero-trust arch implementation etc.
]
_____

Eradication measures
