Legacy Attacks
Considering the age of Bluetooth, many of the better-known and frequently cited Bluetooth attacks and vulnerabilities were discovered in the early to mid-2000s.

Bluejacking
Bluejacking refers to a legacy attack involving sending unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled devices. Unlike Bluesnarfing, Bluejacking does not involve accessing or stealing data from the targeted device. Instead, it uses the Bluetooth "business card" feature to send anonymous messages, typically in text or images. As such, it is often seen as a prank or nuisance rather than a serious security threat.


In a typical bluejacking scenario, the attacker starts by scanning for other nearby Bluetooth devices. The attacker then chooses a target from the discovered devices and proceeds to craft a text message or selects an image. Using the Object Push Profile (OPP), they send unsolicited messages or images to the targeted device.

The Object Push Profile (OPP) is a standard Bluetooth profile that facilitates the basic exchange of objects or files between devices. These objects can range from Virtual Business Cards (vCards), calendar entries (vCalendars), notes, or other forms of data encapsulated in a file.

Notably, this entire process can be accomplished without establishing a paired connection with the target device, making bluejacking a stealthy operation that leaves little trace other than an unexpected message on the recipient's device.

The impact of Bluejacking is generally limited to annoyance or inconvenience; however, in some instances, Bluejacking can be used maliciously. For example, it could be used as part of a social engineering attack, where the unsolicited message is designed to trick the recipient into revealing sensitive information or performing an action that compromises their security, such as installing malware onto their device.

Over time, the awareness about bluejacking spread, and manufacturers and developers began implementing security measures to address the vulnerability, such as changing default settings. These improvements made it significantly more difficult for unauthorised individuals to perform bluejacking.

Apple devices were susceptible to an attack very similar to Bluejacking via AirDrop. AirDrop is a proprietary service Apple provides that allows users to transfer files among supported Macintosh computers and iOS devices over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth—without using mail or a mass storage device.


AirDrop utilises Bluetooth to create a peer-to-peer network between devices. To share a file via AirDrop, the user selects the Share button on the document, photo, or webpage they wish to send, chooses AirDrop, and selects the device within the range they want to share with. When a file is received via AirDrop, it appears as a notification, allowing the user to either accept or decline. If the incoming AirDrop item is accepted, it is automatically saved into the user's Photos, Downloads, or Files folder on their device.

However, this feature has been exploited for spamming purposes.

If your AirDrop was set up to receive files from Everyone, this means that anyone within AirDrop range—roughly 30 feet (9 meters)—could share files with you.

In crowded areas such as concerts, subway trains, or aeroplanes, malicious users could send unsolicited photos or other files to any device set to receive from Everyone. The sending of unsolicited files is often termed AirDrop spamming or cyber flashing. However, Apple modified these settings in iOS 16.2, where the Everyone option had to be explicitly enabled before it automatically disabled itself after 10 minutes, thus only allowing your contacts to send you unsolicited files.

Bluesnarfing
Bluesnarfing is a legacy attack that provides unauthorised access to a Bluetooth-enabled device to extract information, whose origins can be traced back to around 2003. The term derives from 'snarfing,' a colloquial term in computer security, which denotes unauthorised data acquisition, and the 'blue' prefix refers to Bluetooth as the method of access. Thus, Bluesnarfing is essentially a data theft method exploiting Bluetooth connectivity.

Bluesnarfing entails several steps. The process begins with the attacker identifying an active, vulnerable Bluetooth device within range. Subsequently, the attacker exploits a vulnerability in the device's Bluetooth implementation, allowing unauthorised access. Once access is obtained, the attacker can extract information from the device, such as contact information, calendars, emails, text messages, and even media files. Notably, the attack can be perpetrated without alerting the device's owner, making it a surreptitious exploit.

The potential impact of Bluesnarfing is significant, given the nature of data that can be extracted. Personal information, including contact details and media files such as photos and videos, could potentially be used for identity theft or blackmail. Additionally, business-related information, such as meeting details or confidential emails, could be used for corporate espionage or blackmail.

The issue of Bluesnarfing prompted manufacturers and developers to take action. The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG), the organisation responsible for developing and standardising Bluetooth technology, released security advisories and guidelines to address the vulnerability. Device manufacturers released firmware updates and patches to fix security flaws and enhance the overall security of Bluetooth implementations. As a result of these efforts, Bluesnarfing has become less prevalent and is considered less of an issue for modern devices.

Bluebugging
Bluebugging is a form of Bluetooth attack where an attacker gains full control over a Bluetooth-enabled device, allowing them to access and modify information, use the device to make calls, send text messages, and even connect to the internet. This is a much more severe and invasive threat than Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking, given the level of control it provides to the attacker.

Executing a Bluebugging attack is similar to Bluesnarfing, beginning with identifying an active, vulnerable Bluetooth device within range. The attacker then exploits vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth implementation of the device, often by tricking the user into believing they are pairing with a trusted device or brute forcing a Bluetooth pairing PIN on an implementation that does not prompt the user for confirmation. Once access is gained, the attacker can essentially control the device as if it were their own.

The impact of Bluebugging can be severe, given the comprehensive control it provides to the attacker. Personal information such as contact details, messages, and emails can be accessed and modified, or the device can be used to make calls or send messages. Additionally, the device’s microphone and camera can be remotely operated, turning the device into a covert listening device.

Maintaining device security, keeping devices updated with the latest firmware and security patches, and following recommended security practices to mitigate potential risks associated with Bluebugging and other Bluetooth-related vulnerabilities remains crucial.

BlueSmacking
Bluesmacking is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack targeting Bluetooth-enabled devices. The attack exploits a vulnerability in the L2CAP Bluetooth protocol to transfer large packets, taking advantage of the limited processing capabilities of certain devices. Bluesmacking attacks were primarily executed using specialised software tools that generated and transmitted many Bluetooth packets.

Modern Bluetooth devices have implemented improved firmware and software solutions that enable better handling and filtering of Bluetooth packets. These enhancements have significantly reduced the effectiveness of BlueSmacking attacks and made it less of an issue for modern devices.
