Some Modern Bluetooth hacking methods are:

1.BlueBorne

2.KNOB

Key Negotiation of Bluetooth(KNOB) attack represents a sophisticated and potentially devastating form of Bluetooth hacking.
it exploits a flaw in the Bluetooth standard to undermine the encryption of Bluetooth connections.

--->
Bluetooth rely on an encrypted link using a shared encryption key.
During the setup of this encrypted link,devcies agree on the encryption key's length.
KNOB attack exploits lies in this negotiation process.
--->
the attacker intercepts the pairing communication and foribily sets the length of the encryption key to its minimum allowed size,which is only 1 byte.
Once crucial aspect of the KNOB attack is that it does not require knowledge of any previously shared link key.
--->
Best way to protect against a KNOB attack is by ensuring all your Bluetooth-capable devices are updated with the latest software and firmware.
Moreover,the Bluetooth Special Interest Group(SIG),has updated the standard to require a minimum encryption key length of 7 bytes going forwaed.

3.BIAS:

Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS(BIAS) attack targets the secure,simple pairing and connection processes employed by device implementing the Bluetooth BR/EDR(Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate).
this attack method enables the attacker to authenticate themselves by connecting with a victim's device and masquerading as a device already paired with the victim's.
--->
The core vulnerability lies in the fact that during this impersonation process,
[Bluetooth protocol does not require mutual authentiaction-it only requires the device initiating the connection verifies the other party ]
this means that a malicious actor can impersonate a Bluetooth device without knowing the long-term key shared by the impersonated device.
--->
once done a MITM can be performed
--->
BIAS attacks are potentially effective against any device using the Bluetooth BR/EDR specification.
--->
BIAS atack can be mitigated through firmware updates that address the specific vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth Classic protocol.

Mitigation:

1.Keep Devices Updated

2.Disable Bluetooth When Not needed

3.Enable Device Pairing Authorisation

4.Limit Device Visibility

5.Exercise Caution in Public Settings
