Bluetooth,a wireless technology standard,is designed for transferring data over short distances from fixed and mobile devices.
it works by establishing PAN using radio frequencies in the ISM band 2.402 GHz to 2.480 GHz.
Conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables.

_________________
Bluetooth devices form a network known as a piconet.

Multiple piconet can interact to form a large network known as a scatternet.

_________________
Bluetooth specification indentifies 2 types of links for data transfer:

1.Synchronous Connection-Oriented(SCO) Links:

Primalrily used for audio communication,these links reserve slots at regular intervals for data transmission,communication etc.

2.ASynchronous Connection-Less(ACL) Links:

These links cater to transmitting all other types of data.
transmit data whenever bandwidth allows.

Risks of Bluetooth:

the array of risks associated with Bluetooth can be broadly classified into several Categories:

1.Unauthorised Access

2.Data Theft

3.Interference

4.Denial of Service(Dos)

5.Device Tracking

Bluetooth Attacks:

Bluejacking: Sends unsolicated messages

Bluesnarfing: Unauthorised Access to a bluetooth-enabled device's data.

Bluebugging: contol a Bluetooth device.

Car Wisperer: specifically targets vehicles.

Bluesmacking & Dos: disrupt or disable the connection between devices.

MITM: possition themselves between the communicating devices.

BlueBorne: Control of a device without requireing any user interaction or device pairing.

Key Extraction: retrieve encryption keys.

Eavesdropping: Intercepting and listening to bluetooth communications.

Bluetooth Impersonation Attack: Impersonate a trusted Bluetooth device.
