Cryptoanalysis Side-Channel Attacks refer to a category of Cryptographic attacks that exploit information inadvertently leaked during the execution of cryptographic algorithms.

Side-Channel Attacks aim at the physical implementation of these systems.
these attacks leverage indirect information such at timing data,power usage,electromagnetic emissions and signals.

side-Channel attacks could potentially circumvent robust cryptographic algorithms.

________________
Types of Side-Channel Attacks:

1.Passive Side Channel Attacks

2.Active Side-Channel Attacks

________________
Several common forms of side-channel attacks:

1.Timing attacks:

timing attacks are a type of side-attack where an attacker gains information about a cryptographic system based on the amount of time the system takes to processs different inputs.
in these attacks,the attacker measures the computatio time of cryptographic algorithms and make informed gusses abouth the secret key based on the observed variations.

it exploit the fact that different operations and instructions may take a different amount of time to execute on a computer.

2.Power-Monitoring Attacks:

Power-Monitoring attacks aka power analysis attack are a type of side-channel attack that exploit the variations in a device's power consumption to extract sensitive information.
these attacks are based on the observation of power consumption of a device during the device's powerline.

These ar eof 2 types:

----->__--->
Simple Power Analysis(SPA):

the attacker directly interprets the power consumption graph to identify operations.

----->__--->
different Power Analysis(DPA):

this method is more sophisticated and involves collecting power consumption data for many operations and using statistical analysis to find correlations between power consumption and the value of bits in secret key.

________________
Acoustic Cryptoanalysis:

it is a type of side-Channel attack where an adversary seeks to extract sensitive information from a system by analysing the sound emissions it produces during its operation.
These sound emissions often correlate with different internal states or operations of the system,allowing attacker to gain insights into the data being processed.
