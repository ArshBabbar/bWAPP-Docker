Cryptanalysis is a fascinating and essential facet of cybersecurity that delves into the inticate worl of cyphers and codes.

Cryptanalysis is the process of decrypting coded or encrypted data without access to the key used in the encryption process.

--->
Primary objective of Cryptanalysis is not just to decode data.
its goal encompasses assessing and ssuring the strength of encryption techniques and ensuring that information remains secure from potential threats.
--->
plain text refers to the original
cypher text is the scrambled,unreadable form of plain text resulting from an encryption algorithm.
key is the piece of information used in the encryption and decryption process.
in symetric encryption,same key is used
asymetric encryption uses a public key for enccryption and a privare key for decryption.

_____________
Cryptanalysis employs a variety of techniques to break a cryptographic system:

1.Frequency Analysis:

this technique is based on the statistical study of the letters or symbols in cypher text.
if the Frequency of characters in cypher text matches the frequency of letters in the language of plain text,it can give clues to the substitution or transposition methods used.

2.Pattern Finding

3.Brute Force Attacks
